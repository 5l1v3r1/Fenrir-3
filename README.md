FIX Engine for Rapid Information Routing

======

Fenrir is a Gateway for routing FIX messages, with configuration scripts written in LUA and core in C++.

It supports plugins for routing and/or message modification and most of the core modules are decoupled from the main classes,
allowing maximum tunning for specific runtime needs.
